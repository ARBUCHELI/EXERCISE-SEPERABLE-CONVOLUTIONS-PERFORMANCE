Seperable convolutions performance.

## Exercise: Seperable Convolutions Performance
For this exercise your first task will be to calculate the total number of FLOPs in a model that uses separable convolutional layers. The architecture of this sep_conv model is
give below. Your second task will be to then create an inference engine pipeline that can run the model.
